## Hubs

Idea: Graph of Hubs
       rules:
      	 certain distance to build edge
	 certain distance to break edge
	 number of edges determines color of point
	 number of edges determines speed of point
	 direction (sin/cos) is based off speed and color
	 edges are color white color (thin in the middle)
	 
Employed: js, canvas, html5

TODO:
	3 phase:
	  move
	  dots
	  edges - (a stack of edges?)
	  
	  opacity of edge: th - d / th
	  opacity of star: 1 - o (edge) 

pre migratiion to three step:

problems:
I want all o results before I draw
     either edge
     OR	    star
solution:
	move first, then do as I am.
